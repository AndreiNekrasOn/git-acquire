# Git File Assigner

NOTE: THIS WAS CREATED WITH USE OF CHAT GPT. The prompts are included. This was mostly me testing ChatGPT

Merge conflicts are annoying. One possible flow to **never** have them is for two developers to **never** work on the same file. To achieve this, I've vibe-hacked (vibe-coded initially, hacked after) this tool.

This can be replaced with a simple Kanban board, so it's not really needed.

You can:
- Add files
- Assign files to specific developer
- Clear selected assignments
- Delete files
- View which developer has which files
